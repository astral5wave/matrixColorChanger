# Matrix Color Changer

A simple React project demonstrating color changes in a 3x3 matrix using a queue data structure.

## How It Works

- Initially, all 9 boxes are empty.
- When a box is clicked, it turns green.
- Once all boxes are filled (i.e., all turned green), they start changing to orange one by one in the same order they were clicked.

## Key Concepts

- Queue data structure used to track the order of clicked boxes.
- React state manages color changes and click tracking.
